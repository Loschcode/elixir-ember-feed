    <!-- Title -->
    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      I’m a lifelong student first and foremost. I’m always trying to improve myself and learn new things. I’m interested in various fields, mostly coding, business, marketing, psychology linguistic and anthropology.<br /><br />

      I am a seasoned programmer with more than 10 years in SaaS and am well versed in many languages. I try my best to thoroughly understand the technical challenges of each project going in and then choose the most effective platform / language to see it through. Recently most of the projects I’ve worked on have been based in Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and Laravel. I write clean readable and scalable code.<br /><br />

      For the majority of my career I have been in a back-end  position. I’m good at dealing with the server side and know the importance of being able to adapt myself to any given situation / technology. I pride myself in being able to think through complex systems, anticipate problems, and fix them before they happen.<br /><br />
